** Questions:
   - Is implication of error handling is right approach for MSH/DSH
     compat? - *NO*. Switching to reflexive equality.
   - Should MSH err on collisions - *NO*

** Errors returned by MSH =mem_op=:
   - *OOB access in input memory blocks*
    
** Errors retuned by DSH evaluation:
   - running out of fuel [prevented by estimation]
   - *OOB access in input memory blocks*
   - OOB memory index in Mexp [prevented by construction]
   - Variable not found in environment for Nexp, Mexp, Aexp [equality pre-condition]
   - Type mismatch for environment variable in Nexp, Mexp, Aexp [equality pre-condition]
   - Allocating memory at already allocated index [equality pre-condition?]
      
* LLVM IR generation
** General
  - TODO BinOp/1, Poitwise/1 unrolled into scalar operations.
** Vectorization
  - No vector optimizations yet.
  - Arrays only, no vectors.
  - Later/optional: BinOp/n, Poitwise/n compiled into vector operators?
* Template Coq appoach
** Differences between SHCOL deep and shallow embeddings:

    - Shallow is always correct by construction. No errors. Deep
    embedding has errors.
    - Shallow has proofs which are part of expressions. Deep does not
    have any.
    - Shallow uses Coq expressions as elementary functions. Deep uses
    /Lambda/ language.
    - Shallow uses Coq lambda for iterator body. Deep uses lexically
    scoped variables.
    - Shallow operator's implementation is an evaluatable function. Deep
    embedding uses =eval= function.
    - Shallow operators are tagged as typeclass instances. Deep
    operators are constructors in inductive type.

** Lambda language

   Currenly used Lambda functions:
   - =sub,plus,mult,minmax.max=: CarrierA -> CarrierA -> CarrierA
   - =abs CarrierA= -> CarrierA
   - =IgnoreIndex abs=
   - =IgnoreIndex2 mult=, =IgnoreIndex2 Zless=
   - =Fin1SwapIndex2 jf (IgnoreIndex2 sub)=
   - =fun j => h_index_map (proj1_sig j) 1 _= : index_map_family
   - =fun j => h_index_map (proj1_sig j) 2 _= : index_map_family

** Props in operators

   HCOL:
   - =HPointwise= function paramterized by /FinNat/
   - =HBinOp= function paramterized by /FinNat/
   Sigma-HCOL:
   - =index_map= (/index_f_spec/ field enforces domain/range)
   - =index_map_family= just a family of index maps with their own
     specs.
   - eUnion= 'b' paramter must be less than output vector size. (use /FinNat/?)
   - =eT= 'b' paramter must be less than input vector size (use /FinNat/?)
   - =Scatter= index map must be /injective/
   - =SHBinOp= function paramterized by /FinNat/
   - Whenever /Lambda/ function is passed as parameter /Proper/
     instance is required.

** Normalized SHCOL
*** Operatos used in final SHCOL

    Special:

   - SafeCast
   - UnSafeCast
   - SHFamilyOperatorCompose?
   - SHCompose

     Regular:

   - eT
   - eUnion
   - SHBinOp
   - SHPointwise
   - SHInductor
   - IReduction
   - ISumUnion
   - HTSUMUnion

*** Narutal Functions

    We do not need functoins. We need expressions which could be used
    in the following cases:

    - Parameter of eT
    - Parameter of eUnion
    - Parameter of Inductor
    - *Maybe* parameter `n' of =IUnion=, =IReduction=

    We do not need it for parameters of ISumUnion and IReduction!
    These are tied op to dimensions of the data and fixed.

    Q: Can we get away with linear combination of all variables for these?

    Variables are introduced by itereative operators
    (e.g. =ISumUnion=) and their scope is the body of such
    operator. We will use DeBruijn indices instea of variable
    names. To refer to a variable we will us an index which value is
    distance in number of nested scopes between the reference and
    definition. For example the index variable from the iterator
    immediately enclosing the reference will be 0. For example using
    variable names:
     
    ISumUnion j 0 n
       ISumUnion i 0 m
          Pointwise (fun k => k+i+j)

    Using DeBruijn indices:

    ISumUnion 0 n
       ISumUnion 0 m
          Pointwise ((var 0) + (var 1) + (var 2))


    Global variables could be also represented using this approach,
    via enclosed nested binders around whole expression. Each such
    binder will give gloval variable an index.

    Index mapping functions have type: =nat -> nat= We can represent a
    subset of index mapping functions using the folloing encoding:

    Each function is represented a vector of coefficients (natural numbers):

    c = [1,2,3,100]

    When evaluated a vector of all variables in scope is build, ordered by 
    their DeBruijn indices. "1" is appended to the end. Using example above,
    assuming j=12,i=22,k=32:

    v = [12,22,32,1]

    The result of evaluation is dot product of these two vectors: 

    c \dot {v^T} = 1*12 + 2*22 + 3*32 + 100*1

    This allows us to represent expression such as: 

    j*c_0 + i*c_1 + k*c_2

** Proof Automation
*** MSHOL -> DSHCOL proofs

    May not be possible to follow the structure of DSHCOL, as ~DSH_pure~
    are associated with MSCHOL, not DSHCOL operators.

    One way around this is to follow MSHCOL structure. Another
    solution, is to build proof as we compile MSHCOL via template-coq.

    Finally, it /might/ be possible to follow the structure of DSHCOL if
    the mapping of MSHCOL to DSHCOL is injective. Here we will take
    advantage of LTAC pattern matching which provides us with
    look-ahead parser to match DHSCOL fragments to MSHCOL operators.

    For current language we implemented LTAC pattern matching approach
    which seems to be working. With addition of more operators or
    extensions of DSHCOL this may break.
